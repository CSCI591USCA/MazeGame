<!-- 11/3 capstone meeting notes
start thinking about mobile
make the char slightly larger
on comp its easy to see but not mobile
change the maze up a little    right now its only 1 way to get to end chnage it back to old one with multiple

want to bge able to turn around 

once we get first one done it will come easy


right now main job is changing maze? you cant turn around really right now

change timer to FIXED position

be able to customize scene 
try to make maze less complex

make our own maze??
the generated one is too complex and compact
maybe make it a little more open space?    not all straight lines make you able to turn around
make it like pacman if needed (remove certain parts for turns)
start with more customization 
character.    maze.   (do we want to keep random)


mauybe self design maze so its not common (can be very simple for kids)
make levels very easy then get harder

kick time????? so quick i think (like a mom in car line waiting on kid from school)
mazegen.js needs to be modified. or atleast understand it better 
look into the file^^ see if you can use some of the already existing code

we need to be able to change it. Might need to use phasers drag option to do it
